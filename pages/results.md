## Completed 
<div id="text">
I created API calls to obtain all Owner/NFT information from MongoDB, along with completing the calls to update the ledger and ownership tables.
<br/>
<br/>
After getting the functionality of my MongoDB working, I created a Micro Service for my SQLITE3 data that I originally accessed locally. I now have a tab on my navigation bar that allows the user to run the lab with data from Lab2, data from SQLITE3 Micro Service, data from MongoDB Micro Service.
<br/>
<br/>
I created the front-end for my MongoDB and SQLITE3 that looks similar to Lab 2 that was using SQLITE3. These front-ends call my API to query my MongoDB/SQLITE3 databases to retrieve/insert new owners or nfts.
