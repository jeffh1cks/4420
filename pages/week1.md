# Week 1 Update
<br/>

<div id="update">
I created a Ubuntu VM using DigitalOcean and Apache2 to serve the web-content with use of a proxy-pass. I used my domain name given to my server from my CMPS 3680 course and created a route to 4420 where the web application is now hosted. I validated my server by using “CertBot.”

I created the navbar and routes dynamically to each page for the project using jQuery and Javascript. I did this by grabbing the params from the url and taking the file to then match it with its corresponding marked down file.
